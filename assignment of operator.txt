Ans 1.
Statically typed languages perform type checking at compile-time, while dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at run-time. 

Statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.

Ans 2.
In Java, Variables are the data containers that save the data values during Java program execution. 
Every Variable in Java is assigned a data type that designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. 
A variable is a memory location name for the data.

Ans 3.
Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). 
The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
Eg.  int x=10;

Ans 4.
the primitive data types are the predefined data types of Java. They specify the size and type of any standard values. 
Java has 8 primitive data types namely byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean.

Ans 5.
All Java variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Ans 6.
java has the following types of operators:

1.Arithmetic Operators.
2.Assignment Operators.
3.Logical Operators.
4.Relational Operators.
5.Unary Operators.
6.Bitwise Operators.
7.Ternary Operators.
8.Shift Operators.

Ans 7.
 the increment operator ++ increases the value of a variable by 1. Similarly
 the decrement operator -- decreases the value of a variable by 1.


eg. int a=7;
    int b=++a

    int c=5;
    int d=--c;
